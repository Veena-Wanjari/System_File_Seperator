Modules used:

1) The shutil module helps us to automate copying files and directories. It is a utility module which can be used to accomplish tasks, such as: copying, moving, or removing          directory trees. Functions are provided which support file copying and removal: shutil.move(src, dst, copy_function=copy2).

2) The OS module is used to interact with our operating system. The primary use is to create folders, remove folders, move folders, and sometimes change the working directory. 
   We can also access the names of files within a file path by doing listdir().
   os.path.join(path1[, path2[, ...]]) Join one or more path components.
